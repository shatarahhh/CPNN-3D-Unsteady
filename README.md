# 3‑D Unsteady CPNN Prediction of Particulate‑Matter Transport  

This repository uses a composite neural network (CPNN) to predict the particulate matter concentration field solution in a hydrodynamic separator. The CPNN framework details are discussed in the research paper: 
"Operator-based machine learning framework for generalizable prediction of unsteady treatment dynamics in stormwater infrastructure"
