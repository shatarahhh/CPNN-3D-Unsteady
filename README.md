# 3‑D unsteady CPNN prediction of particulate matter transport  

This repository uses a composite neural network (CPNN) to predict the 3‑D particulate matter transport and fate in a hydrodynamic separator under transient loading conditions during a storm event. The CPNN framework details are discussed in the research paper: 
"Operator-based machine learning framework for generalizable prediction of unsteady treatment dynamics in stormwater infrastructure"

## Quick start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shatarahhh/CPNN-3D-Unsteady.git
cd CPNN-3D-Unsteady
pip install -r requirements.txt       
jupyter lab CPNN_predictions.ipynb
